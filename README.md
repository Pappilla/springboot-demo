## Course Overview

### Introduction
Developing your first Spring Boot Web Application is fun.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

In this course, you will learn the basics developing a Basic Todo Management Application using Spring Boot with Login and Logout functionalities.
